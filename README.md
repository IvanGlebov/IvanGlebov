Hi, I’m @IvanGlebov

I'm currentry a third year student studying Computer Science at ITMO University

I have pretty big React experience and in love with TypeScript. I also worked as VueJS developer.

Have experience with the following technologies:
- ReactJS (class components or functional components) | About 2 years of working experience
- Redux (pure JS and TS)
- VueJS | About 1 year of working experience
- MUI
- Webpack
- Esbuild
- Python
- NodeJS (Express)
- Docker | Deploying containers for frontend and not only
- C++ | Used to use a lot earlier, but not very well at it now
- other related technologies related mostly with web-development

My english is B2/C1 and I'm trying to get better in it every day. 

My main interest is web-development and I'll be glad to get an offer for a job)
