Hi, I’m @IvanGlebov

I’m interested in web-development and embedded electronic devices.
I'm currently studying Computer Science at ITMO University.
By myself I learn React/Redux and C++ on advanced level.

I have different Arduino/ESP projects and don't mind if you'll take some code from there. But remember - you're not allowed to use it for commerce! 

Fell free to contact with me via my mail, or Telegram:
